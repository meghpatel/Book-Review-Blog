			</div>
			<div id="review-content">
				<q>A comet the color of blood and flame cuts across the sky. Two great leaders—Lord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon—who hold sway over an age of enforced peace are dead, victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns. Six factions struggle for control of a divided land and the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, preparing to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war.<br><br> 

				It is a tale in which brother plots against brother and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, victory may go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when kings clash, the whole land trembles.<br><br>

				Here is the second volume in George R.R. Martin magnificent cycle of novels that includes A Game of Thrones and A Storm of Swords. As a whole, this series comprises a genuine masterpiece of modern fantasy, bringing together the best the genre has to offer. Magic, mystery, intrigue, romance, and adventure fill these pages and transport us to a world unlike any we have ever experienced. Already hailed as a classic, George R.R. Martin stunning series is destined to stand as one of the great achievements of imaginative fiction.

		<h2>My Review</h2>
		<p>
			It was right about at the beginning of George R. R. Martin’s A Clash of Kings, the second book in his A Song of Ice and Fire series, that I admitted to myself that I wanted to quit my job and everything else in my life so I could stay home and read all day. I resisted the urge. I’m still not quite sure if I made the right decision.<br><br>

			You think you know someone, and then you read the second book about her. (Or him. Though, for the most part, the changes of the hers were more exciting for me in this book. Minus the most clever and entertaining character to waddle through the pages of a fantasy book, who will go unnamed so I don’t spoil the fact that he lived through the first book. Okay, I may have given it away a little.) It’s not that the characters went through any unrealistic shifts; it’s just that Martin let us get to know them even better and we got to watch how they responded to new situations. Or at least I did. You may not have even read A Clash of Kings yet. Your loss. <br><br>

			I think enjoyed the first book more because the slow corruption of an innocent and stable world interested me. But everything else that utterly enthralled me from the first book—the complex and endearing characters, the mystery and intrigue, the moments when honor, family, love, and pride all seem at odds with one another—was there in the second, and was amplified because, with each chapter, I grew more and more invested. <br><br>

			Don’t start this series unless you’re ready to devote yourself to reading every published book of it. I don’t know what I’m going to do when I’ve finished the fourth book and have to sit around waiting for Martin to write and publish the rest. That will be a sad, sad day.<br><br>

			Quotes! <br><br>

			“Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them.”<br><br>

			“He who hurries through life hurries to his grave.” <br><br>

			“A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless.”<br><br>

			“When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain.” <br><br>

			“Only a fool humbles himself when the world is so full of men eager to do that job for him.”<br><br>

			"People often claim to hunger for truth, but seldom like the taste when it's served up."<br><br>

			"There's no shame in fear... what matters is how we face it."<br><br>

			"A man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm."<br><br>

			"When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say."<br><br>

			"The best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, enough to give a listener pause."<br><br>

			"Oh, to be sure, there is much we do not understand. The years pass in their hundreds and their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We look at mountains and call them eternal, and so they seem... but in the course of time, mountains rise and fall, rivers change their courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities sink beneath the sea... Everything changes."<br><br>

			"The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome." <br>
